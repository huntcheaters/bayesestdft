# bayesestdft
This is a C++ re-implementation of the bayesestdft project https://github.com/yain22/bayesestdft.
That project provides several algorithms to estimate the degree or freedom $\nu$ of a set of data 
which follows the Student T distribution.

The current version of this C++ implementation cannot give the same result as the reference project,
not even a close result. This might be the problem of using R source code to generate the random 
normal or uniform distributions. The project or files uploaded are created via Visual Studio 2013, 
in which the source.cpp is the demo to run.
