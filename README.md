# bayesestdft
This is a C++ re-implementation of the bayesestdft project https://github.com/yain22/bayesestdft.
The current version cannot give the same result as the reference project, not even a close result. 
This might be the problem of using R source code to generate the random normal or uniform distributions.
The project or files uploaded are created via Visual Studio 2013, in which the source.cpp is the demo to run.
